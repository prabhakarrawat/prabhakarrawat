#### WORK EXPERIENCE
##### Vizag Steel plant (RINL-VSP),                  Operation & Maintenance Engineer,         			    Feb 2015 â€“ Present
* Efficiently overseeing team of six individuals, ensuring smooth field and DCS operations while adhering
  to SOPs and SMPs for 120 MW facility with remarkable safety record of zero accidents
* Conducting comprehensive analysis of plant components (boilers, turbines, and other utilities), generating reports to
  optimize overall performance and providing actionable recommendations. These have successfully improved the plant's overall
  efficiency and effectiveness by 2.38%
* Successfully commissioned 120 MW green energy project while effectively collaborating with experts from Thermax Ltd 
  and Siemens India Ltd

##### Graviky Labs Inc. (volunteering), 		         Research Consultant,		          March 2021â€“ Nov 2021
* Helped team Graviky validate catalytic CO2-to-Fuel reactor concepts, and make material and instrumentation
  choices leading to a prototype.
* Worked closely with carbon capture and electrochemistry experts and the final reactor design was 16.58% more 
  effective than the previous design for CO2 conversion.
